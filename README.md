# SnapToCoords
Match a set of coordinates to their nearest coordinates in another set.

This simple tool takes two dataframes containing coordinates and finds the nearest point in the second dataframe for each point in the first. Original use case was for mapping coordinates of interest to nearest coordinates from open data.
